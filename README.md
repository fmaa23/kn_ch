## Knockout Challenge Analysis
This project analyzes the effects of gene knockoutsusing scGPT model. 
Tools include extracting embedding pre and post knockout, comparing 
their similarity using cosine similarity scoring and visualization tools,
such as embeddings heatmaps, violin plots of similarity scores, and
UMAPs
